# Backup incase my omarchy goes wrong.

## I'm trying to use omarchy, tired of my old [dotfiles](https://github.com/Ghifaryh/arch-gip).

### List stuff I've been doing with these:
- Using Vivaldi Browser (with disabling "Use Ctrl+Scroll to zoom page" [IT FIXES THE PINCH ZOOM]
- Delete all the web apps
- Figuring out why Cursor app is taking too long to launch
  Here's the configuration
  ```bash
  ELECTRON_OZONE_PLATFORM_HINT=wayland cursor --use-gl=desktop        --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform,WaylandWindowDecorations        --ozone-platform-hint=wayland
  ```

### To do list
[x] Try to figure out to change the wallpaper like my old dotfiles.
